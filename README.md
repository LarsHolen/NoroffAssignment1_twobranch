# Assignment 1: C# Fundamentals

A project built after the Assignment1_CSharp_RPGCharacters.pdf design document.
The design document is included in the project.

## Master branch:
This is the first project, that is based on inheritance.  Without focus 
on any composition/use of interfaces.  Unit testing is done with Xunit.  When you run the program, one can see a character sheet.  And you can equip random items, level up and see the statistics change.

## FactoryAndStrategy
The branch, is the same project.  But changed to use interfaces, behavior design pattern Strategy and creational design pattern Factory method.
