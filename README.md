__Assignment 1: C# Fundamentals __

A project built after the Assignment1_CSharp_RPGCharacters.pdf design document.
The design document is included in the Solution Items folder.

Master branch is the first project, that is based on inheritance.  Without focus 
on any design patterns.  Unit testing is done with Xunit.  When one run the 
program, one can see a character sheet.  And one can equip random items, level
up and see the statistics change.

The FactoryAndStrategy branch, is the same project.  But changed to use 
interfaces, behavior design pattern Strategy and creational design pattern
Factory method.
