# Assignment 1: C# Fundamentals

A project built after the Assignment1_CSharp_RPGCharacters.pdf design document.
The design document is included in the Solution Items folder.

## Master branch:
This is the first project, that is based on inheritance.  Without focus 
on any design patterns.  Unit testing is done with Xunit.  When one run the 
program, one can see a character sheet.  And one can equip random items, level
up and see the statistics change.

## FactoryAndStrategy
The branch, is the same project.  But changed to use interfaces, behavior design
pattern Strategy and creational design pattern Factory method.
